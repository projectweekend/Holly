    h2 What is it?

    p
        | Originally, this began as a home server/personal dashboard project for my Raspberry Pi: 
        a(href="https://github.com/projectweekend/Pi-Holly", target="_blank") Pi-Holly
        | . I love the Pi, but as the project grew I started wishing I had a little more power under the hood.
        | So I removed the Raspberry Pi specific components from Pi-Holly, and re-launched it simply as 
        strong Holly 
        | . Eventually, I started working on a major overhaul to the 
        a(href="https://github.com/projectweekend/Pi-Red-Dwarf", target="_blank") modules
        |  that would collect and report data back to 
        strong Holly
        | . While doing that, I re-examned everything and decided to give it a fresh start.
        | I learned so much working on the first two drafts of this project, and I really wanted to apply that knowledge.
        | Additionally, this was also an opportunity to move Holly off of my local network and onto the web so I could access it from anywhere and show it off a bit.
