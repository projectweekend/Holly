    h2 What is it?

    p
        | Originally, this began as a home server & personal dashboard project for my Raspberry Pi:
        a(href="https://github.com/projectweekend/Pi-Holly", target="_blank") Pi-Holly.
        | I love the Pi, but as the project grew I started wishing I had a little more power under the hood.
        | So, I worked to removed any Raspberry Pi specific components from Pi-Holly and re-launched it simply as Holly.
        | Everything was great.

    p
        | Eventually, I started working on a major overhaul to the
        a(href="https://github.com/projectweekend/Pi-Red-Dwarf", target="_blank") modules
        | that would collect and report data back to Holly.
        | While doing that, I re-examned this project and decided to give it a fresh start.

    p
        | I learned a lot in the first two drafts of this project, and I really wanted to apply that knowledge.
        | Additionally, I also wanted to get Holly off of my local network and onto the web so I could access it from anywhere and show off a project I've had a lot of fun building.

    h2 How was it built?
