Starting Over
=====

Originally, this began as a home server project for my Raspberry Pi: [Pi-Holly](https://github.com/projectweekend/Pi-Holly). I'm a huge fan of the Pi, but as the project grew I started wishing I had a little more power under the hood. So, I worked here and removed any Raspberry Pi specific components. Everything worked great. Eventually, I started making some changes to other [modules](https://github.com/projectweekend/Pi-Red-Dwarf) that collect data and report back to Holly. While doing that, I re-examned this project and decided to give it a fresh start. I learned a lot building Holly the first time, and I'm going to make good use of that knowledge this time around.
