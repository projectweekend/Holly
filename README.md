### Development environment

The development environment uses [Docker](http://www.docker.com/) and [Fig](http://orchardup.github.io/fig/). This makes it super easy to get up and running with a configuration that will closely mirror production. A [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) config file is included for operating systems that cannot yet run Docker natively.
